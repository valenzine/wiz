# PR Review with GitNexus

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: graph-uncertainty — bearing regenerates this block; edits here are replaced on update -->
## The graph can be wrong

A zero is not absence; a near-0.5 `r.confidence` edge is a lead, not proof (~92% of `USES`); a count
can be a floor — `impact` says which in `epistemic`. Before a conclusion that matters, confirm with a
scoped `Grep` (allowed here, not a gate violation) and say which check you ran.

## Workflow

```
1. `npm run bearing:branch-status -- <base>` to confirm current branch/base and suggested MCP calls
2. gitnexus_detect_changes({ scope: "compare", base_ref: "main", repo: "wiz", branch: "<current-branch>" })
3. Review summary.risk_level, changed_symbols, affected_processes
4. For HIGH/CRITICAL or unexpected processes → impact on changed entry points with the same `branch`
5. For security/input/file/db/exec changes → `bearing-security-review` (`explain`, `pdg_query`, `trace`)
6. Recommend tests per affected process
```

## Risk interpretation

| detect_changes risk | Action |
| --- | --- |
| LOW | Spot-check affected processes + related tests |
| MEDIUM | Run all affected process test dirs |
| HIGH | Full integration tests; require explicit reviewer sign-off |
| CRITICAL | Treat as architectural change — verify every affected_process |

## What GitNexus adds over git diff

- Maps hunks to **symbols**, not just files
- Traces **execution flows** (processes) impacted
- Surfaces **cross-module** effects grep misses
- Gives **risk level** heuristic for prioritization
- With v1.6.8 layers, can add `trace`, PDG impact, and taint findings for risky changes

## Example

```
detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main", branch: "feature/my-branch"})
→ 12 changed symbols, 8 affected processes
→ <entry symbols the diff touches, from the result>
→ Risk: CRITICAL

Follow-up:
→ impact upstream on each changed entry symbol
→ Recommend: tests covering the affected processes
→ Flag: change crosses multiple unrelated clusters — confirm intentional
```
