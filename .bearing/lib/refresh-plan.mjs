/**
 * Choose the CHEAPEST refresh that actually fixes what is wrong.
 *
 * Every automatic refresh path used to run `analyze --force --embeddings 0 --skills --pdg` — a full
 * rebuild — on every commit and on any staleness at all, including two files behind. Measured on a
 * 220-file repository: 2s for a no-op, 21s incremental, 43s forced. On a 3,000-file product repo the
 * same full build takes just under ten minutes, and it ran at every commit.
 *
 * `analyze` is already incremental; `--force` is the opt-in. So the fix is not a new indexer, it is
 * to stop asking for a full rebuild when nothing needs one.
 *
 * THE ONE PLACE `--force` IS GENUINELY REQUIRED. `analyze` short-circuits on "Already up to date"
 * BEFORE it reaches the embeddings and PDG steps, so on a current graph `--embeddings` and `--pdg`
 * are silently ignored. A graph built without embeddings therefore cannot gain them from an ordinary
 * refresh — verified: two `--embeddings 0` runs left it at 0, and only `--force` produced them.
 * Every deny message says "resync with bearing:refresh", which for that repo could never work.
