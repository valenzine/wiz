 * Run the cheapest refresh that fixes what is actually wrong.
 *
 * Diagnose first, then act: `check-staleness` already knows how many SOURCE files moved, whether
 * embeddings exist and whether the history diverged, and that is everything needed to pick between
 * doing nothing, an incremental pass, and a genuine full rebuild. Before this, every automatic path
 * asked for the most expensive option unconditionally.
 *
 *   node .bearing/lib/refresh-cli.mjs [root] [--pdg] [--force] [--dry-run]
 *
 * Exit 0 when the index is usable afterwards — including when there was nothing to do. A refresh
 * that fails is reported by the caller, which decides whether that blocks anything (it must not:
 * NS-5, a false deny is worse than a missed gate).

// versus a forced rebuild, and this is a local measurement, not a fact about the project.
