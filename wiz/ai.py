"""AI analysis via an OpenAI-compatible chat API (Ollama by default).

Sends a transcript (and optionally on-screen frames) to a chat model for
summary, action items, implementation plans, session notes (walkthroughs),
or freeform analysis. The default analyze path auto-detects whether the
transcript is a meeting (→ summary + action items), a feature/task discussion
(→ a structured implementation plan), or a walkthrough/explanation session
(→ session notes); explicit ``--summary`` / ``--actions`` / ``--plan`` /
``--prompt`` flags override the detector.

Uses only ``urllib.request`` — no new dependency. The request format is the
OpenAI vision message shape:

    content: [
        {"type": "text", "text": ...},
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}}
    ]

This works with Ollama (``/v1/chat/completions``), LM Studio, vLLM, and any
OpenAI-compatible server. Frames are base64-encoded only at send time so the
on-disk manifest stays small (paths only).

    Short inputs (one chunk) use a single ``chat_text`` / ``chat_vision`` call —
    identical to the old behavior, so existing single-call tests keep passing.

    Long inputs are split into contiguous chunks. The map phase is
    **rolling-context** (chat-style): each chunk's prompt carries forward the
    prior chunks' partial analyses as a running context block, so chunk N can
    refer back to speakers/decisions/entities/open threads established in chunks
    1..N-1 instead of analyzing in a vacuum. The reduce step then merges the
    (already coherent) partials into one final answer. With frames, each chunk
    carries only the frames for its own segments, so the vision model sees a
    small, coherent window of "these frames + this text" plus the running
    context instead of one giant blob.

    ``context_turns`` caps how many prior partials are injected as context for
    a given chunk (a sliding window — the last ``context_turns`` partials),
    bounding prompt growth on very long inputs. ``0`` disables the rolling
    context (each chunk analyzed independently), which is the old behavior.

    Built-in prompts (summary / actions / summary+actions / plan) route through
    ``MAP_PROMPT`` + ``SYNTH_PROMPT`` so the final answer has the same structure
    the non-chunked path would produce. Custom ``--prompt`` text is applied per
    chunk (with rolling context prepended for chunks after the first) and the
    per-chunk answers are merged with a generic reduce.

    **Essentials is always on.** Every analysis (built-in or custom, single-call
    or map-reduce) also produces a dense ``## Essentials`` bullet list — every
    meaningful point (facts, decisions, requirements, names, numbers, UI details,
    open questions) — appended to the same response, for feeding to a later AI
    analysis as concentrated context. For built-in prompts the instruction rides
    on the ``{task}`` label in MAP/SYNTH; for single-call and custom paths it's
    appended to the prompt template. Zero extra model calls.

    ``on_progress(msg)``, if given, is called with a short status string before
