"""Speaker voice profiles — cross-recording speaker recognition.

When a user names a speaker (via `--name-speakers` or `--speakers-names`),
wiz can save a *voice profile*: a fixed-size embedding vector for that
speaker cluster, computed with the same sherpa-onnx embedding extractor used
for diarization. On later recordings, each detected cluster's embedding is
compared (cosine similarity) to the stored profiles, and a name is
auto-assigned when the best match exceeds ``speaker_match_threshold``
(config, default 0.8).

Profiles live at ``~/.config/wiz/speakers/<Name>.json``::

    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "dim": 256,
      "embedding": [0.0123, -0.0456, ...],
      "created": "2026-08-17T01:11:55Z",
      "samples": 14
    }

The store uses simple JSON files (one per name) so they're inspectable and
easy to delete. Profiles **merge** across recordings: each time a speaker is
re-named, the new cluster's embedding is combined with any existing one via a
sample-weighted running mean (see ``save_profile``), so the stored voice
profile grows more accurate over time instead of being overwritten by each
run. sherpa-onnx is an optional dependency, imported lazily.
